In this project a currency converter app in three different versions.
In the first version(Convert.html and CurrencyConverter.java) the converter accepts only three rates(EUR,USD,GBP).
It the second version(Converter_Rates.html and CurrencyConverterFromFileServlet.java) the converter reads the rates from the txt file euro_rates(In the WEB-INF).
In the third version we have the first version but this time in a jsp file.
